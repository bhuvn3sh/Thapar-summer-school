# Thapar-summer-school
During the summer of 2023 I enrolled in the Machine learning course of thapar summer school,where I learned a lot of new things like pyhton,use of libraries like panda,matplotlib etc. in python, and machine learning and the scope of AI in the future and many more.I did not only gather knowledge about the tech domain but our teachers also emphasised on development soft skills like public speaking and team work, they also guided us to prepare for our job interviews by providing us with interview puzzles everyday.This repository contains some of the mini projects and assignments I completed during that course of time.
